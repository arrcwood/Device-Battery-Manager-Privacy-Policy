# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 2, 2025

Your privacy matters deeply to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the Device Battery Manager (\"we,\" \"our,\" or \"the app\") handles your information. In short: we don't collect, store, share, or sell any personal data—ever.

## 1. Data Collection

The app does not collect any personal or identifying information. We do not request your name, email address, location, or any other personal details. There are no accounts and no sign-ins.

## 2. Local Data Storage

All information you enter—such as device names, battery types, replacement dates, and estimated power levels—is stored only on your device. This data never leaves your phone or tablet and is never transmitted to us or to any third party.

## 3. Permissions

The app does not request access to your contacts, camera, location, or any other sensitive device features. It only stores and retrieves the data you provide for your own tracking purposes.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The app does not use analytics tools, advertising networks, or third-party services that collect user information.

## 5. Data Security

Because all data remains local, your privacy is fully in your hands. We encourage users to back up their device data through their operating system's standard backup methods if they wish to preserve their battery records.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The app is safe for all ages. Since no personal data is collected, it complies with privacy regulations protecting children's data (such as COPPA in the U.S. and GDPR-K in the EU).

## 7. Changes to This Policy

If we make changes that affect how your data is handled (for instance, if we ever add optional cloud backup), we will update this Privacy Policy and include a notice in the app before any change takes effect.
